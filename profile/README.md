## What is this?

**t0k3nr** is a collection of microservices that watches cryptocurrency markets with the intensity of a caffeinated day trader, analyzes wave patterns like it's reading tea leaves, and occasionally suggests trades that may or may not make you rich (spoiler: probably not).

Built with the blood, sweat, and tears of someone who thought *"How hard can algorithmic trading be?"* — the answer, it turns out, is **very**.

## The Stack

| Project | What it does | Success Rate* |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **commons** | Shared code so we can fail consistently across all services | 100% |
| **stats** | Crunches numbers. So many numbers. Why are there so many numbers? | ∞ |
| **simulator** | Lets you lose imaginary money before losing real money | Therapeutic |
| **trader-gdax** | Talks to Coinbase like an old friend who owes you money | "It's complicated" |
| **trader-kraken** | Releases the Kraken. Sometimes regrets it. | 🐙 |

*\*Success rate measured in vibes, not financial returns.*

## Disclaimer

This software is for educational purposes. If you use it to trade real money and something goes wrong, we recommend the time-honored tradition of:

1. Closing your laptop
2. Going outside
3. Touching grass
4. Pretending crypto doesn't exist
